# AI Policy Framework for a Flourishing Future
<!-- **version - August 31st, 2025** -->

## Preamble
**Purpose.** This policy aims to ensure AI is developed and deployed to *preserve and enhance human life, protect creation, and promote broad-based flourishing*, while safeguarding rights and enabling responsible innovation.

**North Star.** AI should be a *helper* that augments human capability, not a replacement for human dignity or agency.

---

## Core Principles
1. **Human dignity & agency first** — people remain accountable decision-makers for high-impact uses.
2. **Preservation & planetary care** — prioritize safety of people, animals, and the environment.
3. **Proportional, risk-based oversight** — obligations scale with *actual risk*, rather than simply following rules or checklists.
4. **Transparency & accountability** — clear documentation of intended use, data provenance, and known limits.
5. **Open, fair, and secure innovation** — protect competition, support interoperability, and deter misuse.
6. **Education & upskilling** — pair adoption with workforce transition plans so communities benefit.

## Governance Architecture

### A. Risk-Tiering (Use-Case Based)
- **Tier 0 — Minimal risk** (assistive tools, internal prototypes). *No filings.*
- **Tier 1 — Limited risk** (customer-facing copilots, content tools). *Light duties:* disclaimers, basic logging, opt-out.
- **Tier 2 — High-impact** (hiring/credit/health/critical infra, autonomy in the loop). *Full duties:* pre-deployment safety case, red-team evidence, impact assessment, human-in-command, post-market monitoring.
- **Tier 3 — Prohibited uses** (untargeted manipulation, illegal surveillance, autonomous lethal use, large-scale rights violations). *Banned.*

### B. Tier Triggers
- **Context:** sector sensitivity (health/finance/critical infra).
- **Autonomy:** ability to act without human confirmation on consequential tasks.
- **Scale:** people affected and frequency of decisions.
- **Capability flags:** demonstrated abilities for cyber-offense, bio-risk enablement, targeted persuasion, or model-exfiltration.
- **Harm history:** real incidents elevate tier until remediated.

### C. Who Does What
- **National AI Commission (independent):** sets standards, certifies Tier-2 auditors, runs incident portal.
- **Sector regulators:** tailor rules to domain; accept the same safety case format.
- **Regulatory sandboxes:** time-boxed approvals for novel Tier-1/2 deployments with shared telemetry.
- **Local ombuds + redress:** complaint channel with binding response timelines for Tier-2 systems.

### D. The Safety Case (Tier-2 Systems)
- Intended use & limits (and exclusions).
- Data & provenance (including known biases).
- Model evaluation (reliability, robustness, harmful capability tests).
- Human-in-command plan (escalation/override).
- Security posture (model/data access, jailbreak resistance).
- Post-market plan (telemetry, incident response <72h, rollback).

### E. Innovation Guards
- **Safe harbor for Tiers 0–1:** no pre-approvals; simple notice & checklists.
- **Open-source & research shield:** exempt unless crossing Tier-2 triggers.
- **Interoperability standards:** capability cards, audit APIs, portable logs.
- **Fast-track updates:** if change doesn’t alter risk tier, no new filing.
- **Sunset clauses:** every new rule auto-reviews in 24 months unless re-justified.

### F. Proportional Enforcement
- **Fix-first:** remediation orders for first-time non-wilful issues.
- **Graduated penalties:** scaled to harm/scale; personal liability only for wilful negligence.
- **Right to explanation & appeal** for individuals harmed by Tier-2 decisions.

### G. Workforce & Community Impact
- **Impact assessment:** jobs/tasks affected, mitigation plan.
- **Upskilling set-aside:** small % of deployment budget or tax credit-matched fund for training displaced/adjacent workers.

## Next Steps for Stakeholders
1. **Review** this framework and identify alignment with local values and priorities.
2. **Discuss** proportionality: where do we need stricter safeguards, and where must innovation remain unchoked?
3. **Propose amendments** in open consultation.
4. **Vote and ratify** a consensus draft.
5. **Pilot** in limited domains via sandboxes, then refine.

## Conclusion
This framework is designed to be *“just enough”* — avoiding the twin dangers of over-regulation (which stifles innovation) and under-regulation (which leads to chaos). By adopting a risk-tiered, principle-driven approach, governments, industries, and communities can ensure that AI becomes a co-creator in building a sustainable and flourishing future for humanity and creation.

### Definitions and Concepts:

**Red-team evidence**: A "red team" is a group that intentionally
challenges and tests the system's robustness. This component likely
involves ensuring that the system can withstand adversarial attacks or
unexpected scenarios.

**Human-in-command**: Emphasizes the importance of human oversight and
decision-making in critical situations where AI or autonomy may be
involved.

**Local Ombuds**: An ombuds (short for ombudsman) is an independent, neutral office or person that people can go to when they feel wronged by an organization or system. In the AI policy context, a local ombuds would be a trusted contact point — not inside the company that built the AI — where citizens or workers can raise complaints about how an AI system affected them.

**Redress**: providing a remedy or fix when harm has occurred. In policy terms, it ensures that if an AI system unfairly denies you a loan, misclassifies your medical data, or causes reputational harm, there’s a clear process to:

- Investigate the complaint fairly.

- Require correction, explanation, or rollback.

- Provide compensation or other remedies if harm was significant.
